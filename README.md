I wanted to create randomized yet similar planets-ish images.

I originally attempted to use Python and Pillow, but that turned out to be incredibly limited and hardly fitting for what I was trying to accomplish.  The script newLineTest.py is this experiment and it still generates an interesting visual.  The default values currently generate 10 images and 10 corresponding log files for each image.

My second and more educated attempt uses script-fu from GIMP, and gives me access the the full abilities GIMP offers.  Currently my process involves creating solid noise in an allipse and bluring that.  This should give you an idea of the direction I am going.
